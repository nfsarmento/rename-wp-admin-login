== Description ==

*Rename wp-admin login* is a plugin that allows us to rename wp-admin login URL to anything you want. It does not change WordPress core files, the plugin simply intercepts page requests and works on any WordPress website. After you activate this plugin the wp-admin URL and wp-login.php will become unavailable, so you should bookmark or remember the url.
